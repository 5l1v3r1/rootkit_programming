Module Description:

This kernel module impplements a rudimentary port knocking feature. 
It takes 3 arguments as inputs:
	-> The local port of the service that we want to hide. (The service must be running)
	-> The IP address from which connections are accepted. 
	-> The protocol (TCP or UDP) 

Tested in Linux Debian 3.16.4 x86_64.

Files inside :
        1. port_knocking.c and other source-/header-files - the LKM
        2. gensysmap.sh - bash script to generate sysmap.h
        3. Makefile - the Makefile
        4. README - what you are reading right now

How to use:


1. Build the LKM.
        $ make
        > rootkit_group4.ko and other object files will be created.

2. (Optional step) : Check the running services
	One way of doing is run nmap on perticular ip address (eg. nmap 127.0.0.1, default is tcp for udp pass -sU)
	get the port number on that ip to hide.

3. Load the  LKM.
        $ insmod rootkit_group4.ko ipv4=###.###.###.### port=<port_number> protocol=<tcp or udp>
     	where ### is in the range of 0-255
	

4. Verification: 
	The hidden service should only run/showup for the specified ip address. 
	nmap on the specified ip: The port/service should show up
	nmap on any other ip: the service should be hidden

5. Unload the module
        $ rmmod rootkit_group4
