Module Description: 

This kernel module hides all files starting with 'rootkit_' or '.rootkit_'. The latter was added because some
applications create temporary files starting with a '.' (I'm looking at you, vim). Symlinks to files with such
prefixes will also be hidden.
 

Files inside :
        1. hidefiles.c - LKM
        2. gensysmap.sh - bash script to generate sysmap.h
        3. Makefile - the Makefile
        4. README - what you are reading right now

How to:


1. Build the LMK.
        $ make
        > hidefile.ko and other object files will be generated.

2. (Optional step)
	$ echo "I'm hidden!" > rootkit_hidden
	$ ln -s ./rootkit_hidden symlink_to_hidden
	$ ls -alh
	> Create a file that should be hidden after the LKM has been loaded. Also add a
	> symlink to it. Check that you are able to see them.
 
3. Load the hidefiles.ko LKM. 
        $ insmod hidefiles.ko 
	
4. Check if the files are hidden.
	$ ls -alh
   	> You can verify that the specified files and symlinks to these are hidden.
